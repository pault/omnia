  <field type="literal_value" name="doctext">Alright.  This is supposed to be a somewhat informal browsing 
around of the general fetures of the system.  
&lt;p>First, the general concept of Everything:
&lt;center>&lt;h3>Nodes and Links&lt;/h3>&lt;/center>

&lt;p>Everything is a node, that is, everything in this system
is nodes.  All of these nodes can be strung together with 
links, but we'll get to that later.  Nodes have different nodetypes,
which determines what information the Node contains, as
well as how it is displayed to the user.  Nodetypes are
also nodes.  Ah...  recursion...
&lt;p align=center>&lt;b>First, there was [Nodetype]&lt;/b>
&lt;p>The first node in the system is "Nodetype" because we 
needed it to create new nodetypes from it.  The page you are
on right now is a [superdoc].  You can get a good idea of some
of the other nodetypes by going to the [Gigantic Node Lister]...

&lt;p>Lemme go over some of the other types:
&lt;p>&lt;b>HTMLPAGE&lt;/b>&lt;br>
These are "templates" for viewing nodes.  They have two 
associations:  the node type, and the viewing mode.  Right
now you are viewing the tour in the [superdoc display page],
and back when I wrote this, I did so in the [superdoc edit page].
Display and edit are the two major types (display being the 
default) but there are a few other ones that become useful
later on...
&lt;p>If you took a look at the superdoc display page, you noticed
that it looked pretty simple.  As a matter, there are three lines:&lt;br>
