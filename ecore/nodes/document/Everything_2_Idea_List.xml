&lt;p&gt;Links

&lt;p&gt;Links are designed to provide a way to relate two
nodes to each other.  Links are created when users
traverse from one node to another.  However, not all
links are "good" or wanted.  We want to create a system
where the less useful links die off.

&lt;p&gt;To do this, we will think of links as living organizms.
Link get "food" by users searching or clicking on a link.
Links use the food at some specified rate.  If they run
out of food, they starve to death and die.

&lt;p&gt; What this provides is a system where links live and
die by how the users use the system.  A kind of genetic
algie.  The links that live will, in general, be more
useful as more users will use them.  Less useful inks
will evenually starve to death and go away.  This way
the system evolves to provide useful links as determined
by the way the system is used.

&lt;p&gt;Link specifics
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Searches give "bonus food" to a link.  This gives
    trail blazing links a chance at becoming a usable
    related link.  The bonus is a variable number that
    can be adjusted for different systems.
&lt;li&gt;A clicked link gives 1 or more food units to the link
    every time a user clicks on it.  This allows oft
    traveled links to stay healthy and even become popular.
&lt;li&gt;Every so often (once a day?) the system goes through
    the links and subtracts X food units from each link.
    The "X" could be a fixed number, or calculated based
    on how many hits or food units were given out in that
    time period.  This subtraction of food will eventually
    starve the less useful/popular links which will cause
    them to die off.
&lt;li&gt;Links can be granted immortality by the maintainers
    of the system.  Some links should not die off just
    because they are not popular.  For example, Ken and
    Barbie should always be linked.  That link should be
    granted immortality since it should never die off.
    It may not be listed in the most popular links list,
    but it will always be a link.
&lt;li&gt;When displaying the most popular links, we should
    randomize their order so that the top link doesn't
    get all of the hits just because its the first in
    the list.  This would force users to look through
    the list to find relevant items.  Thus weeding out
    the nonsense "this link is popular because its first"
    crap.  This would allow the less popular ones to die
    out easier since fewer people would click on them.
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Themes

&lt;p&gt;Themes or "skins" allow users or system admins to set the
look and feel of the site.  The basic parameters that we
could allow them to change are colors (bgcolor, text, etc)
and perhaps even auto generate images.

&lt;p&gt;This could be a very powerful feature that would allow
third parties to modify the site such that it resembles
their site.  This would allow them to link to our site
while making the end user believe that they are still at
their site.  They get the exposure, we get the ad revenues.

&lt;p&gt;Also, this would allow us to change the look of a site
instantly by modifying the theme of the site, which would
be extremely useful when developing a new site.  We may
even want to allow users to specify a theme so they can
make the site look how they want it to.

&lt;p&gt;User Notes
&lt;p&gt;User notes are kind of like alerts at etrade.  Users can
send notes to eachother.  We could have an "note" nodelet
that would tell the user when they have new notes.  The
user could then go to their user page and read the notes
that they have, delete them, or even reply to them.  We
may want to implement notes as actual email.  That would
allow users to read their email from the site and send
email to other sites, but that may be a little too much
for right now.  Just a thought...
