There's a world of fun in http.conf (usually located in the /etc/apache
or /etc/httpd -- /usr/local/apache/conf if you grew your own apache). 
Here's the lines to make sure are commented in:


LoadModule perl_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_perl.so
	#unless you have mod_perl compiled in...

#this next section might be in access.conf
<Directory "/var/www">#or whereever you put the script (document root)
	
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI
			#make sure ExecCGI is on in the options...
	AllowOverride None
# Controls who can get stuff from this server.
	order allow,deny
	allow from all
</Directory> #end the directory

								 

#this might be in your srm.conf 
DirectoryIndex index.html index.pl
	#make sure index.pl is in there 


AddHandler perl-script .pl

PerlModule Apache::DBI 	
PerlHandler Apache::Registry
PerlSetupEnv On


__END__

You probably won't be able to just append this to your http.conf, but 
search for the tags, and some of these lines you'll probably just have to 
comment in.  If you have any other configurations that help Everything,
