There's a world of fun in http.conf, and while our Makefile.PL and
install_esite /should/ make manipulating it easier -- sometimes it's
better to roll your own.

Here's the lines to make sure are commented in:

LoadModule perl_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_perl.so
	#unless you have mod_perl compiled in...

#this next section can go in a separate file 
<Directory "/var/www">#or whereever you want to put the script 
	
	DirectoryIndex index.html index.pl
	#make sure index.pl is in there
    
	Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI
	#make sure ExecCGI is on in the options...
	
	AllowOverride None
	order allow,deny
	allow from all
</Directory> #end the directory

								 
AddHandler perl-script .pl

PerlModule Apache::DBI 	
PerlModule CGI
PerlSetupEnv On


__END__

You probably won't be able to just append this to your http.conf, but 
search for the tags, and some of these lines you'll probably just have to
comment in.  The default install will put these lines in a separate file,
(everything.apache.conf) and use an "Include" directive to include them in.
