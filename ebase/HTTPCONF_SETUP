There's a world of fun in http.conf (usually located in the /etc/apache
or /etc/httpd -- /usr/local/apache/conf if you grew your own apache). 
Here's the lines to make sure are commented in:


LoadModule perl_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_perl.so
	#unless you have mod_perl compiled in...

#this next section can go in a separate file 
<Directory "/var/www">#or whereever you want to put the script 
	
	DirectoryIndex index.html index.pl
	#make sure index.pl is in there
    
	Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI
	#make sure ExecCGI is on in the options...
	
	AllowOverride None
	order allow,deny
	allow from all
</Directory> #end the directory

								 
AddHandler perl-script .pl

PerlModule Apache::DBI 	
PerlModule CGI
PerlSetupEnv On


__END__

You probably won't be able to just append this to your http.conf, but 
you can put this in a separate file and append

Include /path/to/my/file

to the end of your httpd.conf
