This Bundle exists to install the perl modules that are required for the
Everything Engine.  

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install
perl -MCPAN -e shell
cpan> install Bundle::Everything

if you don't want to use CPAN.pm for your perl modules (for instance, you
want to get them from rpms or debs -- *shiver*) instead consult the 
PERLMOD_SETUP file in the top level everything directory
