Quick Installation Guide
-------------------------

All version numbers for all binaries and perl modules are the minimum
known to work.  Older versions may work, but newer versions are probably better.

STEP 1 - Install needed binaries

You need the following RPMs (or equivilent) installed:

Perl-5.005 (or 5.6)
MySQL-3.22.25
MySQL-bench-3.22.25
MySQL-client-3.22.25
MySQL-devel-3.22.25
apache-1.3.6
mod_perl-1.19

You can install the apache and mod_perl RPMs, but we strongly recommend
that you download the apache and mod_perl source code and compile mod_perl
into apache.  It will make things a little faster and you won't need to
configure apache as much to get mod_perl to work.

STEP 2 - Install needed perl modules

In addition to binaries, you will also need a handful of perl modules.

Consult the PERLMOD_SETUP file if you want to install your modules
by hand (from www.cpan.org) -- or if you prefer to use the CPAN.pm
module, use Bundle::Everything, in the Bundle/ directory.


STEP 3 - Configure your Apache httpd.conf

Now that you have all of the needed binaries and perl modules installed,
you need to modify your apache httpd.conf file so that it knows how to
deal with mod_perl.  If you already have apache and mod_perl setup, you
can probably skip this section.

If you want to, Everything will keep track of its own sites in a
everything.httpd.conf file in the Everything install dir.  The Makefile
will append an "Include" directive to the bottom of your existing httpd.conf.
This does not try to include the mod_perl.so module, but it will provide
the .pl perl handler.  If nothing else, try it.  It works on the default
Apache conf.

See HTTPCONF_SETUP for the specifics of this step.


STEP 4 - Install Everything

To install Everything, you first need to untar the everything-x.xx.tar.gz.
ebase installs just like a perl module.  To install ebase:

> cd ebase
> perl Makefile.PL
> make
> make install (as root)

When you run "perl Makefile.PL", it will ask you some questions:
Where you want to install Everything (default /usr/local/everything).
This is the place Everything stores its files that it needs.  Also, whether
or not you want Everything to try and get httpd.conf to work.

Once you have ebase installed, you need to install a site.
To do this:

bin/install_esite MY_NEW_EVERYTHING

This will set up a new mySql user (optional), copy files into an appropriate
web directory, create the database, and install the base nodes in the system.
Depending on the speed of your machine, this can take up to a few minutes.

At this point you should be able to go to http://localhost/your/path/index.pl
and load up a page.
