Quick Installation Guide
-------------------------

All version numbers for all binaries and perl modules are the minimum
known to work.  Older versions may work, but we don't guarantee it.
Newer versions are probably fine.

STEP 1 - Install needed binaries

You need the following RPMs (or equivilent) installed:

Perl-5.005
MySQL-3.22.25-1.i386.rpm
MySQL-bench-3.22.25-1.i386.rpm
MySQL-client-3.22.25-1.i386.rpm
MySQL-devel-3.22.25-1.i386.rpm
apache-1.3.6-7.i386.rpm
mod_perl-1.19-2.rpm

Other optional utilities that you may want to install to make things a
little easier:

sudo-1.5.6p2-1.i386.rpm


You can install the apache and mod_perl RPMs, but we strongly recommend
that you download the apache and mod_perl source code and compile mod_perl
into apache.  It will make things a little faster and you won't need to
configure apache as much to get mod_perl to work.

To do this, untar the apache and mod_perl source code into /usr/src.  Go
into the mod_perl directory and type 'perl Makefile.PL'.  It will ask you
if you want it to automatically build apache too.  Say yes.  When it is
finished, type 'make install' (as root).  That's all you should need.

STEP 2 - Install needed perl modules

In addition to binaries, you will also need a handful of perl modules.
You can get all of these from www.cpan.org.  You will want to install
them in the order listed, otherwise you may get dependency errors.

ApacheDBI-0.82
CGI-modules??  (this is commonly installed by default with mod_perl)
DBI-1.13
XML-DOM-1.27
XML-Parser-2.27
MIME-Base64-2.11
Mail-Sender-0.6.7
libnet-1.0607
MailTools-1.13
Data-ShowTable-3.3
Msql-Mysql-modules-1.2202
Digest-MD5-2.09
HTML-Parser-3.07
URI-1.05
libwww-perl-5.45


The libnet module has support for many network protocols.  If you want
Everything to be able to send email to users automatically, you will need
to properly configure libnet for your machine/network.  If you don't care
about email, just install libnet with the defaults (blank info).


STEP 3 - Configure your Apache httpd.conf

Now that you have all of the needed binaries and perl modules installed,
you need to modify your apache httpd.conf file so that it knows how to
deal with mod_perl.  If you already have apache and mod_perl setup.  You
can probably skip this section.

See HTTPCONF_SETUP for this step.


STEP 4 - Install Everything

To install Everything, you first need to untar the ebase-x.xx.tar.gz.
ebase installs just like a perl module.  To install ebase:

> cd ebase
> perl Makefile.PL
> make
> make install (as root)

When you run "perl Makefile.PL", it will ask you three questions.

Where you want to install Everything (default /usr/local/everything).
This is the place Everything stores its files that it needs.

Where you want your web directory for Everything to be (default
/usr/local/apache/htdocs).  This is where web visitors will find your
everything website.

Which database you want to use (default everything).  This is the name
of they mysql database to use for the Everything system.

Once you have ebase installed, you need to install the ecore nodeball.
To do this, simply type:

nbmasta import path/to/ecore-x.xx.nbz name_of_database

(see nbmasta for parameters).

This will install the base nodes in the system.  Depending on the speed
of your machine, this can take up to a few minutes.

TA DA!  You should now have a working installation of Everything!
