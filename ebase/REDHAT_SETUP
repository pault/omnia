I'm running Everything on a REDHAT 6.0 box -- a Sony Viao p266 with 96 megs.
Actually, I would really like to upgrade this box to debian -- but haven't
had the time yet.

Here's the RPM's which I recommend to be installed on the system:

MySQL-3.22.25-1.i386.rpm        
MySQL-bench-3.22.25-1.i386.rpm 
MySQL-client-3.22.25-1.i386.rpm
MySQL-devel-3.22.25-1.i386.rpm 
sudo-1.5.6p2-1.i386.rpm
apache-1.3.6-7.i386.rpm
mod_perl-1.19-2.rpm

there might be some play in the versions -- this is just what I used...

I also re-made my apache by hand for various optimizations.  You shouldn't
need to do this unless your Everything server is under quite a load.

I put these on a pretty robust install -- but these should at least let
you know of any dependencies that they have when you rpm -i them.  
If you have any more information on running Everything on Red Hat email
Nate Oostendorp <nate@blockstackers.com>...

other stuff you need to do to set up is mentioned in HTTPD_CONF and PERLMOD_CONF
the default mod_perl rpm installs as an apache loadable module.
