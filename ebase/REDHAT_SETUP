Here's the RPM's which I recommend to be installed on the system:

MySQL-4.0.i386.rpm        
MySQL-bench-4.0-1.i386.rpm 
MySQL-client-4.0-1.i386.rpm
MySQL-devel-4.0-1.i386.rpm 
sudo-1.5.6p2-1.i386.rpm

#you can skip these two if you are installing from source
apache-2.0.i386.rpm
mod_perl-2.0.rpm

there might be some play in the versions.

I put these on a pretty robust install -- but these should at least let
you know of any dependencies that they have when you rpm -i them.  

other stuff you need to do to set up is mentioned in QUICKINSTALL,
HTTPCONF_SETUP and PERLMOD_SETUP

the default mod_perl rpm installs as an apache loadable module.
