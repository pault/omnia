Everything Base

This is the base to the Everything system.  This sets up the install
directory and creates the basic database needed to "boot-strap" the
system.  Once the base is installed, you will need to install the
ecore nodeball.

Requirements:

here's whats required for Everything to work:

Perl (5.005)
Apache (1.3.6) with mod_perl module 
	(note-- you'll probably have to edit your http.conf) 
Mysql (3.22.27)
	(note-- all scripts currently run as root, with no password.  This is /not/ recommended
	 if you are doing a live site.  You'll have to hard-code it, for now)

Currently the version numbers are what I'm running on my devel server.  Older versions might work,
but newer versions probably work better.  For more information about system requirements, check out
the REDHAT_SETUP and/or DEBIAN_SETUP files.

Nodeballs

What is a nodeball?  A nodeball is a "package" of nodes for your
Everything system.  Nodeballs are somewhat similar to RPMs or DEB
packages.  They allow you install specific functionality to your
Everything system.

The nodeball utility is nbmasta, which is in the scripts directory.  It's 
very simple to use:

nbmasta import (nodeball file or directory) DATABASE

nbmasta export "name_of_nodeball" DATABASE

-- by default, files with the .nbz extention are used -- but these files
are gzipped tarballs, so if you want to see the innards, merely
tar -xvzf them.

The Ecore nodeball (as well as other distributed nodeballs) are typically in
the "nodeballs/" directory of your Everything release.  Ecore is required to do 
anything.  All other nodeballs are optional.

Installation

See the various "setup" files.  You will need to make sure you have
the appropriate perl modules installed, along with making sure that
you have apache, mod_perl and mysql set up appropriately.

the various files are:

DEBIAN_SETUP -- information on installing your system primarily with debs
REDHAT_SETUP -- also for other flavors of Linux.  Required packages
HTTPCONF_SETUP -- the lines you will need in your httpd.conf file for E to work
PERLMOD_SETUP -- a list of required perl modules

to do the base install

> perl Makefile.PL
> make
> make install

Running 'perl Makefile.PL' will ask you some questions about how you
want to install the system.  By default, it will install it on the
machine.  You will need to run 'make install' as root.

After you have installed a default database you will need to add the core 
system, as well as whatever nodeballs you want. 

If you are only a mortal user on the system (no root access), you
can specify alternate directories to install where you have write
permissions.  Since you cannot copy the perl modules (Everything.pm
and the Everything directory) to the proper perl system directories,
you will need to copy them somewhere else and specify that directory
in the index.pl file by adding the line:

use lib "path_to_directory_that_contains_Everything";

before "use Everything::HTML".  Otherwise, the Everything modules
will not be found.

After you have Everything installed, you may want to add the bin
directory in the Everything install to your path so you have access
to the scripts needed to maintain your Everything system.


Uninstall

> make realclean (as root)

Note that executing 'make realclean' will remove everything.  This
includes the perl modules and the associated database.  After this
is executed the Everything system will not exist.  Don't execute it
unless you really mean it.  I'm serious.
