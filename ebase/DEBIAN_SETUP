If your using Debian, you have a powerful ally: apt-get.  I installed a 
Debian 2.1 (slink) base install, and then used apt-get install to get the 
following packages.  The whole thing is pretty tight (~200 megs), and has 
everything you need to run mod_perl/apache scripts.

Of course, I was at work.  You could probably get by using the following 
packages on the latest distro CD...

optional: a few devel that I use(d).  You may or may not need these.

psmisc
bin86
make
gcc
sudo
libncurses4-dev
libc6-dev
vim
cvs
cvs-buildpackage
analog
ssh

required stuff (at least these are the ones that I run):

mysql-base
mysql-doc
mysql-server
apache
apache-common
apache-dev
apache-doc
libapache-mod-perl
libdbd-mysql-perl
libmysqlclient6-dev


once you have those packages, all you need to do is run apacheconfig, 
answering "yes" to the perl question (though you may want more features).

Then take a look at HTTPCONF_SETUP and PERLMOD_SETUP to see what other
stuff you need to do to make it work!

Debian, email Nate Oostendorp <nate@oostendorp.net>...
