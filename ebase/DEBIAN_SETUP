If your using Debian, you have a powerful ally: apt-get.  I installed a 
Debian 2.1 (slink) base install, and then used apt-get install to get the 
following packages.  The whole thing is pretty tight (~200 megs), and has 
everything you need to run mod_perl/apache scripts.

Of course, I was at work.  You could probably get by using the following 
packages on the latest distro CD...

optional: a few devel that I use(d).  You may or may not need these.

psmisc
bin86
make
gcc
sudo
libncurses4-dev
libc6-dev
vim
cvs
cvs-buildpackage
analog
ssh

required stuff (at least these are the ones that I run):

mysql-base
mysql-doc
mysql-server
apache
apache-common
apache-dev
apache-doc
libapache-mod-perl
libmysqlclient6-dev
(optionally, apache-perl can replace libapache-mod-perl)

these are packages for perl modules -- I highly recommend that you use
Bundle::Everything and/or CPAN.pm instead, but these will work

libdbd-mysql-perl
libxml-perl
libxml-generator-perl

once you have those packages, all you need to do is run apacheconfig, 
answering "yes" to the perl question (though you may want more features).

if you have any information that would be useful in using Everything on
Debian, email Nate Oostendorp <nate@oostendorp.net>...
