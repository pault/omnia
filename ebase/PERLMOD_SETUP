Here's the list of perl modules that I installed to make everything work.
Your system may have some of these already installed.  Otherwise, you 
can always get the latest version from CPAN <http://cpan.org>.

The easy way to install from CPAN is to use the included Bundle::Everything
module.  Check out the README in the everything/Bundle directory on how
to install using it.

The version numbers are the one that I have...  not necessarily the only
ones which would work.

These are required modules to get Everything to work (it uses Mysql)
	DBI (1.13)
	Msql-Mysql-modules (1.2202)

These are needed for the Everything::HTML module 
	CGI
	ApacheDBI (0.82)

These are needed for the Everything::XML module
	XML-Parser (2.27)
	XML-DOM (1.27) 

Everything::Mail
	Mail-Sender (0.6.7)
	Mail-Tools

And to use the Gigantic Code Lister:
	Devel::Peek

Everything::Nodeball
	File::Spec (0.82)
		(this IS a file in std distribution, but early versions (.6) don't have
			rel2abs())

To run the test suite:
	Test::Exception
	Test::Simple
	Test::MockObject

each of these is simple to install from a tar.gz file:

tar -xvzf MODULE.tar.gz
cd MODULE/
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test  (sometimes)
make install (as root)
