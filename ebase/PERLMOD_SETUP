Here's the list of perl modules that I installed to make everything work.
Your system may have some of these already installed.  Otherwise, you 
can always get the latest version from CPAN <http://cpan.org>.

The version numbers are the one that I have...  not necessarily the only
ones which would work.

These are required modules to get Everything to work (it uses Mysql)
	DBI (1.13)
	Msql-Mysql-modules (1.2202)

These are needed for the Everything::HTML module 
	CGI
	ApacheDBI (0.82)

These are needed for the Everything::XML module
	XML-Generator (0.4)
	XML-Parser (2.26)

Everything::MAIL
	Mail-Sender (0.6.7)
	Mail-Tools

each of these is simple to install from a tar.gz file:

tar -xvzf MODULE.tar.gz
cd MODULE/
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test  (sometimes)
make install (as root)
